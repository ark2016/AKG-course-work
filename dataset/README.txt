\f0\fs24 \cf0 DETAILS ABOUT FOX IMAGE FILES\
\
Photos were taken by Scoutguard SG565F-8M camera traps. \
\
JPEG image files are organised in one folder per survey: survey_1_summer_2013, survey_5_autumn_2013, survey_10_winter_2013 and survey_17_spring_2014. \
\
Image folders were compressed to .gzip files via the Mac OS terminal, using command <tar -czf NEW_FOLDER_NAME.tar.gz FOLDER_NAME/>\
These files can be decompressed using terminal command <gunzip FOLDER_NAME.tar.gz>.\
\
The fox ID of the individual identified in each image is found in image_list.csv, matched to the image filename. \
\
Images are named with date and timestamps, i.e. YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg. \
\
There is one copy of the image per individual, so images containing two individuals will appear twice in the folder. Images with the same timestamp may be suffixed with \'91_001.jpg\'92 or \'91_002.jpg\'92 \
\
Some daytime images are photo bursts (1-3 photos taken in quick succession, within 1-2 seconds). A 3-photo burst will be named similar to: [image.jpg, image_001.jpg, image_002.jpg]. \
